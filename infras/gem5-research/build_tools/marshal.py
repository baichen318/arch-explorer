"""Marshal another python script.

This script compiles another script, marshals the resulting code object, and
writes it to stdout. Marshalling an object in this sense is essentially what
would happen to write it out in a pyc file.

This code object can then be read back in by another python script later and
executed, without having to have access to the original file. This is how
python code is embedded into the gem5 binary.

The output of the marshal module is *not* generally compatible accross python
interpretters, and so the exact same interpretter should be used both to run
this script, and to read in and execute the marshalled code later.
