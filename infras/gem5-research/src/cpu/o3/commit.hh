/**
 * Commit handles single threaded and SMT commit. Its width is
 * specified by the parameters; each cycle it tries to commit that
 * many instructions. The SMT policy decides which thread it tries to
 * commit instructions from. Non- speculative instructions must reach
 * the head of the ROB before they are ready to execute; once they
 * reach the head, commit will broadcast the instruction's sequence
 * number to the previous stages so that they can issue/ execute the
 * instruction. Only one non-speculative instruction is handled per
 * cycle. Commit is responsible for handling all back-end initiated
 * redirects.  It receives the redirect, and then broadcasts it to all
 * stages, indicating the sequence number they should squash until,
 * and any necessary branch misprediction information as well. It
 * priortizes redirects by instruction's age, only broadcasting a
 * redirect if it corresponds to an instruction that should currently
 * be in the ROB. This is done by tracking the sequence number of the
 * youngest instruction in the ROB, which gets updated to any
 * squashing instruction's sequence number, and only broadcasting a
 * redirect if it corresponds to an older instruction. Commit also
 * supports multiple cycle squashing, to model a ROB that can only
 * remove a certain number of instructions per cycle.
