    This prebuilt X86 board is used for demonstration purposes. It simulates
    an X86 3GHz quad-core system with a 2GB DDR3_1600 memory system. A
    MESI_Two_Level cache hierarchy is set with an l1 data and instruction
    cache, each 32kB with an associativity of 8, and a single bank l2 cache of
    1MB with an associativity of 16.

    **DISCLAIMER**: This board is solely for demonstration purposes. This board
    is not known to be representative of any real-world system or produce
    reliable statistical results.

    Example
    -------

    An example of using the X86DemoBoard can be found in
    `configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run.py`.

    To run:

    ```
    scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j`nproc`
    ./build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run.py
    ```
