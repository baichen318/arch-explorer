"""
A Resource object encapsulates a gem5 resource. Resources are items needed to
run a simulation, such as a disk image, kernel, or binary. The gem5 project
provides pre-built resources, with sources, at <resources.gem5.org>.

The purpose of this encapsulation is two fold:

1. It allows automatic retrieval of gem5 resources. E.g., specifying a resource
   which is not local will initiate a download.
2. It provides a location where code may be added to record the resources used
   within a simulation. At present this is a TODO work-item.
