Python 3 is now required.

The following are steps to compile gem5 in Python 3 environment,

*Step 1*: ensure Python 3 is installed. On Ubuntu like systems, you can try \
this command:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python-is-python3 python3-pydot

To run Python 3 from a container, you can try the Docker files in \
util/dockerfiles folder.

*Step 2*: ensure that scons is run in the Python 3 environment. If scons \
isn't run automatically with Python 3, you can force it by replacing `scons` \
by the following phrase,

    /usr/bin/env python3 $(which scons)

For example, the following command will let scons compile gem5/X86 in the \
Python 3 environment,

   /usr/bin/env python3 $(which scons) build/X86/gem5.opt

(Optional) For convenience reasons, you can set up an alias for the Python3 \
scons phrase in your environment. \033[0m
