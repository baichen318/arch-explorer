# Input choices (some are default and thus implicit):
# - use small cache size to encourage races
# - use small system size to encourage races since more requests per CU (and
#   faster sim)
# - use small address range to encourage more races
# - use small episode length to encourage more races
# - 50K tests runs in ~30 seconds with reasonably good coverage
# - num-dmas = 0 because VIPER doesn't support partial cache line writes, which
#   DMAs need
