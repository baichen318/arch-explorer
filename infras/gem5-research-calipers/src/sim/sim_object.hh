/**
 * Abstract superclass for simulation objects.  Represents things that
 * correspond to physical components and can be specified via the
 * config file (CPUs, caches, etc.).
 *
 * SimObject initialization is controlled by the instantiate method in
 * src/python/m5/simulate.py. There are slightly different
 * initialization paths when starting the simulation afresh and when
 * loading from a checkpoint.  After instantiation and connecting
 * ports, simulate.py initializes the object using the following call
 * sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>SimObject::init()
 * <li>SimObject::regStats()
 * <li><ul>
 *     <li>SimObject::initState() if starting afresh.
 *     <li>SimObject::loadState() if restoring from a checkpoint.
 *     </ul>
 * <li>SimObject::resetStats()
 * <li>SimObject::startup()
 * <li>Drainable::drainResume() if resuming from a checkpoint.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @note Whenever a method is called on all objects in the simulator's
 * object tree (e.g., init(), startup(), or loadState()), a pre-order
 * depth-first traversal is performed (see descendants() in
 * SimObject.py). This has the effect of calling the method on the
 * parent node <i>before</i> its children.
 *
 * The python version of a SimObject class actually represents its Params
 * structure which holds all its parameter settings and its name. When python
 * needs to create a C++ instance of one of those classes, it uses the Params
 * struct's create() method which returns one instance, set up with the
 * parameters in the struct.
 *
 * When writing a SimObject class, there are three different cases as far as
 * what you need to do to support the create() method, for hypothetical class
 * Foo.
 *
 * If you have a constructor with a signature like this:
 *
 * Foo(const FooParams &)
 *
 * you don't have to do anything, a create method will be automatically
 * defined which will call your constructor and return that instance. You
 * should use this option most of the time.
 *
 * If you have a constructor with that signature but still want to define
 * your own create method for some reason, you can do that by providing an
 * alternative implementation which will override the default. It should have
 * this signature:
 *
 * Foo *FooParams::create() const;
 *
 * If you don't have a constructor with that signature at all, then you must
 * implement the create method with that signature which will build your
 * object in some other way.
 *
 * A reference to the SimObjectParams will be returned via the params()
 * API. It is quite common for a derived class (DerivSimObject) to access its
 * derived parameters by downcasting the SimObjectParam to DerivSimObjectParams
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     using Params = DerivSimObjectParams;
 *     const Params &
 *     params() const
 *     {
 *         return reinterpret_cast<const Params&>(_params);
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * We provide the PARAMS(..) macro as syntactic sugar to replace the code
 * above with a much simpler:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     PARAMS(DerivSimObject);
 * \endcode
